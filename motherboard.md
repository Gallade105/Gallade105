# Motherboards

The motherboard is the main circuit board in your computer and is used as a connector for all the parts in your PC. 

-----------------------

Picking out a motherboard can be very tricky since there are so many different brands and its not always easy to know if they're compatible with certain parts. They might not end up fitting inside of your computer case which could end up causing a lot of trouble if you plan to build a computer.

It is also a real possibility that the bios on your motherboard will not be update to support the CPU that you own. The 2 solutions to that would be getting a cheaper CPU that is compatible with is that to update the bios first. You could also exclusively search for a motherboard that is already compatible with the CPU you're planning to purchase.  

If you're planning to build a PC I'd recommend using [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/) as a resource to confirm your motherboards compatibility.
