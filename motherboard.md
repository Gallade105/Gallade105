# Motherboards

The motherboard is the main circuit board in your computer and is used as a connector for all the parts in your PC. 

-----------------------

Picking out a motherboard can be very tricky since there are so many different brands and itâ€™s not always easy to know if they are compatible with certain parts. They might not end up fitting inside of your computer case which could end up causing a lot of trouble if you plan to build a computer.

It is also a real possibility that the bios on your motherboard will not be updated to support the CPU that you own. The 2 solutions to that would be getting a cheaper CPU that is compatible with it to update the bios first. You could also exclusively search for a motherboard that is already compatible with the CPU you are planning to purchase.  

If you are planning to build a PC I would recommend using [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/) as a resource to confirm your motherboards compatibility.
