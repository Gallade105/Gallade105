# Video Cards
When choosing a video card there is a few things that you need to consider.
- Would it fit into my case?
- The price
- What am I looking for from my video card?

The video card is installed into the motherboard and is responsible for graphic rendering. They're especially useful for tasking like video editing and getting higher frame rates or improved graphics while gaming.

Typically you don't want to invest too much into a video card if you're not planning to do tasks that doesn't require an impressive video card. 

As of writing this video cards have skyrocketed in price due to Covid damaging development and large stocks of them being purchased for bitcoin mining.

That is why I would be careful about purchasing an impressive video card at the moment since they're being sold at increasingly raised prices.
