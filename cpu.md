# The CPU
The CPU which is short for *central processing unit* is the core component. It is responsible for the general processing that your computer can handle. The CPU is input into your motherboard and is generally covered with a cooling device to prevent it from overheating. 

A CPU is not compatible with every motherboard and sometimes the brand of the CPU will not match the motherboard. Often you will be required to update the bios of a motherboard with an older and more compatible CPU before the CPU you'd like to use will work.

Here is a website with information on motherboard CPU compatibility.

When building my PC this website was invaluable to making sure that all of my parts were compatible.
