# Storage
Storage is used for storing the files on your computer and depending on what type of storage you're using on it can affect the speed of your pc. 

Typically what people use for their pcs are SSD's (solid state drives) and hard drives. An SSD doesn't have any moving components and is much faster but it is typically much more expensive than than a hard drive. 

A hard drive had a spinning disc inside of it that has information copied onto it. They're typically good for holding large amounts of storage and are cheaper but they're also much slower than SSDS. 

What many people do is install their pcs operating systems onto an SSD with low storage and used a hard drive for most files. The operating system being installed on an SSD will mean much quicker booting speeds for your pc.
