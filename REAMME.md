# What You Need When Putting Together a PC
## By Alec Schuetz
The purpose of the tutorial is to show the reader what parts they will need if they're planning to build a PC or to inform the reader about the parts inside of a PC. 

The target audience of this guide is to help people who are unfamiliar with pc parts or might have interest in building one for their classes or personal use. I thought of covering this subject since the cyber security video decided to go over all these parts and many of our subjects brought up these parts individually.

## Primary parts inside a pc:

- [CPU](https://github.com/Gallade105/Gallade105/blob/main/cpu.md)
- [Video Card](https://github.com/Gallade105/Gallade105/blob/main/videocard.md)
- [Motherboard](https://github.com/Gallade105/Gallade105/blob/main/motherboard.md)
- [System Memory](https://github.com/Gallade105/Gallade105/blob/main/memory.md)
- [Storage](https://github.com/Gallade105/Gallade105/blob/main/storage.md)
- [Power Supply Unit](https://github.com/Gallade105/Gallade105/blob/main/psu.md)
