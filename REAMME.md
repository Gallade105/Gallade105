# What You Need When Putting Together a PC
## By Alec Schuetz
The purpose of the tutorial is to show the reader what parts they'll need if they're planning to build a PC. 

The target audience of this guide is to help people who are unfamiliar with pc parts or might have interest in building one for their classes or personal use. I thought of covering this subject since the cyber security video decided to go over all of these parts and many of our subjects brought up these parts individually.
