# System Memory
The system memory or RAM (Random Access Memory) is a non-volatile memory that is used for storing memory that can be read or changed in any order. 

RAM is a non-volatile memory so unlike the systems storage the memory being held on the RAM sticks will be lost if the power is turned off.

Ram sticks are inserted into the motherboard and depending on the motherboard you can insert typically 2-4 sticks. Many people purchase RAM for the purpose of duel channel. So if they want 16gbs of RAM they'd buy their RAM in a 2X8 method. Purchasing RAM for duel channel is intended to increase the bandwidth which will typically show an increased performance.
